## Value Investing Strategy
I combine a value factor, the quarterly eranings per share of stock, with a low volatilty beta, to create, backtest, and then optimise the number of shares and rebalancing frequency to arrive at a realistic value investing strategy.

## Data Driven Strategies
This is a project to understand the use of classifier models and their application in Quabtitative Finance. I start with fitting a decision tree model based on feautres like, eqp, unemployment rate, low volatility, momentum, federal rate, etc. I then Boost and Bag to check for improvements.
